minetest-bot-php
A bot for Minetest servers.
================
Licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0.

Please use this bot for beneficial purposes. If this bot is used for griefing, I may not be inclined to maintain it more. 

Requires PHP 5.3 or higher. Will emulate handling of null-terminated strings as PHP 5.5 has not been released, and users may be slow to switch.

Note that although this uses PHP, it requires PHP is run as a script, NOT VIA A WEBSERVER.

Useful things to have:

MySQL 5.5 or higher
A non-Windows OS.
A stable internet connection.
Wireshark and an installation of Minetest in case something goes wrong.
